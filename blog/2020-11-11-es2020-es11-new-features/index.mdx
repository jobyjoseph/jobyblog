# ES2020 / ES11 New Features

## globalThis

As the name suggests, `globalThis` stands for the global value of `this`. To know the global value of `this`, we just have to create a JavaScript file with a line to print its value.

```javascript
console.log(this); // window
```

The output of above line varies based on the environment in which we run the code. If we run above code in Nodejs, the output is `global`. Inside a webworker, the output is `self`.

Now JavaScript is not constrained to a browser environment. So `globalThis` is an attempt to unify the different global terms. So instead of `window`, `self` or `global`, we can use `globalThis` from 2020.

```javascript
console.log(globalThis); // window
```

Above code is executed in a browser.

## Promise.allSettled()

This method ensures that all promises are settled, which means either resolved or rejected. In the following 3 promises, second promise is rejecting.

```javascript
const p1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
const p2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(reject, 2000));
const p3 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(resolve, 5000));

Promise.allSettled([p1, p2, p3]).then((values) => console.log(values));
```

Even though `p2` is rejected, we will get the output like below after 5 seconds.

```javascript
[[object Object] {
  status: "fulfilled",
  value: undefined
}, [object Object] {
  reason: undefined,
  status: "rejected"
}, [object Object] {
  status: "fulfilled",
  value: undefined
}]
```

> `Promise.all()` cannot handle rejected case. All the promises passed to `Promise.all()` should be resolved to work.

## Nullish Coalescing Operator(??)

In JavaScript, we use OR operator(`||`) to check a value and assign a default value if not present. We have an object here.

```javascript
const account = {
  amount: 4000,
};
```

We are reading a property which is not there in `account` object.

```javascript
const interestRate = account.interestRate;
console.log(interestRate); // undefined
```

Since we are accessing a non-property of `account`, it returns `undefined`. Now, using `undefined` in mathematical operations can break things. So we need to send a default interest rate if it does not exist.

```javascript
const interestRate = account.interestRate || 10;
console.log(interestRate); // 10
```

Now, our account turns to a special account with no interest. So the `account` object looks like below.

```javascript
const account = {
  amount: 4000,
  interestRate: 0,
};
```

As per our earlier code, if `account.interestRate` returns a falsy value("", 0, false, null, undefined), number 10 is returned. So, instead of 0, the interest rate will be 10 in all calculations.

So now we need to explicitly check if the value of `interestRate` property is `null` or `undefined`. Here is the updated full code.

```javascript
const account = {
  amount: 4000,
  interestRate: 0,
};

let interestRate;
if (account.interestRate != undefined && account.interestRate != null) {
  interestRate = account.interestRate;
} else {
  interestRate = 10;
}
console.log(interestRate); // 0
```

Just for doing a `undefined` or `null` check, we added lot of code. Nullish Coalescing Operator(`??`) makes this job easy. `??` checks only `undefined` or `null`. So our code can be rewritten as below.

```javascript
const account = {
  amount: 4000,
  interestRate: 0,
};

let interestRate = account.interestRate ?? 10;
console.log(interestRate); // 0
```

Latest babel supports this feature.
