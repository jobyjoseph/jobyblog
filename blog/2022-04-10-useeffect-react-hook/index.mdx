`useEffect()` hook brings different life-cycle methods to a **functional component**. This hook performs side-effects in functional component. If you did not get any idea, do not worry. You can understand in detail by reading below sections.

## Import useEffect

`useEffect()` hook comes as part of `react` package from React **v16.8**. In order to use `useEffect()` in our code, first step is to import it from React package.

```javascript
import { useEffect } from "react";
```

## useEffect() Arguments

`useEffect()` hook accepts two arguments, a **callback function** and an **array**.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Callback function");
}, []);
```

The callback function passed to `useEffect()` is invoked as a side-effect on change of any state variables.

What all state variables we need to track, that information is passed to the second array argument.

## No Dependency Array

We learned that `useEffect()` accepts two arguments. In that, second argument is called the **dependency array**. What if we are not passing the second argument?

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Oh! Side-effect is triggered.");
});
```

Here, since `useEffect()` does not have any dependency array to check against, it will invoke the callback function on component load and on every state change.

Here is a code which you can try:

```javascript
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

export default function () {
  const [random, setRandom] = useState();

  //highlight-start
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Oh! Side-effect is triggered.");
  });
  //highlight-end
  const buttonClickHander = () => {
    setRandom(Math.random());
  };

  return <button onClick={buttonClickHander}>Click Me!</button>;
}
```

Above code updates the value of `random` state variable on each button click. The `"Oh! Side-effect is triggered."` message is printed in the console on the component load and on every button click. You can try above code online at [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-hooks-idcwej?file=/src/useEffect/noDependencyArray.js).

## Empty Dependency Array

Here, we are passing the second dependency array argument as an empty array(`[]`). That is the way of telling React that, there are no state variables to watch for. Therefore, in this case, the `useEffect()` callback function will run only once when the component loads.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Loaded on component load");
}, []);
```

Above code is equivalent to `componentDidMount()` lifecycle method in **class components**.

You can play with `useEffect()` hook with empty dependency array in [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-hooks-idcwej?file=/src/useEffect/emptyDependencyArray.js).

## Selective Dependency Array

Say, we have two state variables in our component. And, we want `useEffect()` hook to invoke the callback function, only when **one of the state variable changes**. In this case, we need to pass only that state variable name to the dependency array.

```javascript
const [color, setColor] = useState();
const [age, setAge] = useState();

useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Color changed!");
}, [color]);
```

Here is the full component code which changes the `color` and `age` values through a button click.

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";

export default function () {
  const [color, setColor] = useState();
  const [age, setAge] = useState();

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Color changed!");
  }, [color]);

  const colorClickHander = () => {
    setColor(Math.random());
  };

  const ageClickHander = () => {
    setAge(Math.random());
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={colorClickHander}>Change Color</button>
      <button onClick={ageClickHander}>Change Age</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Since we are tracking only the `color` variable, changing the value of `age` does not have any side effect.

When the above component loads, it prints the `"Color changed!"` message once. Later, we can see the message logged again only when the value of `color` changes.

## Async Callback Function

What if we need to use `await` inside `useEffect()` callback function? Here is how the code we wish to write:

```javascript
useEffect(async () => {
  console.log("hi");
  // do something with await
}, []);
```

> Before trying `async` in your code, ensure that `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime` is installed and configured in `.babelrc` file.

Using `async` directly in the callback function is NOT allowed by React. It throws a very detailed error along with a solution approach.

```
Warning: useEffect must not return anything besides a function, which is used for clean-up.

It looks like you wrote useEffect(async () => ...) or returned a Promise. Instead, write the async function inside your effect and call it immediately
```

As suggested in the error message, we can go for an IIFE inside the effect to achieve our goal:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // highlight-start
  (async () => {
    console.log("hi");
  })();
  // highlight-end
}, []);
```

## Callback Returning a Function

In class components, there is a lifecycle method called `ComponentDidUnmount()`. The method is fired when a component is **removed** from the DOM. Usually, some logic like clearing a timer is executed inside this lifecycle method. Now the question is, how can we bring that lifecycle method to a functional component?

As we just learned, `useEffect()` accepts a callback function and a dependency array. Usually the callback function returns `undefined`. Instead, we are going to **return a function** now:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    console.log("The returned function");
  };
}, []);
```

This returned function is invoked when the component is removed from the DOM.

In order to test this, we need to write a logic in the parent Component to hide this component based on some condition.

```javascript
const App = () => {
  const [showComponent, setShowComponent] = useState(true);

  return (
    <div>
      {showComponent && <MyComponent />}
      <br />
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          setShowComponent(false);
        }}
      >
        Hide
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

As we can see, in the parent component, we are hiding our component when the button is clicked. So, when user clicks on the button, we can see `"The returned function"` in the browser console.

Some of the cases that might need componentDidUnmount are clearing timers, unsubscribe RxJS events or websocket events, detach event handlers.

You can see the working code online at [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-hooks-idcwej?file=/src/useEffect/componentDidUnmount.js).
