In order to setup Next.js, it is very easy to start with `create-next-app`. This command sets up everything in a folder which you mention. Now, if you are person who would like to do everything from bits and pieces, there is also a way for that.

<!-- truncate -->

## Install Dependencies

At first, create a folder to hold our project. Eg: `nextjs-from-scratch`.

In the terminal, navigate to this newly created folder. Initialize the folder as an NPM package using:

```
npm init -y
```

Add `react`, `react-dom` and `next` dependencies using:

```
npm install --save react react-dom next
```

You can also use `yarn` or `pnpm` to install these packages.

## Run Scripts

In the `package.json` file, add the following run scripts:

```javascript
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start",
  "lint": "next lint"
}
```

`next dev` starts our application in development mode. It supports hot reloading.

`next build` takes a production build.

`next start` starts a production server. In this command, we will use the production build.

`next lint` runs Next.js built-in ESlint configuration.

## Folder Structure

Create a folder called `pages` at the root level. In Next.js page urls are constructed based on the folder and file structure inside `pages` folder.

For example, `/pages/about.js` creates a path called `/about`.

Create a `public` folder in the root for storing static asset. If we have an image `logo.png` under `public` folder, we can refer to it in our page using `/logo.png`.

## First Page

In order to see the home page, create an `index.js` file under `pages` folder.

The index file should export a React component. For that, add the following code in `index.js` file.

```javascript
const Home = () => <h1>Home page - Backbencher.dev</h1>;

export default Home;
```

In order to test our application, run `npm run dev` in the terminal.

By default, the site will be running in `localhost:3000` port. In my case, there was another app running in `3000` port. Therefore Next.js automatically tried in the next port number which is `3001`.

Here is our home page:

When running Next.js in development mode, we also get following benefits:

- Auto compilation and bundling
- React fast refresh
- Static generation and server side rendering of `/pages`
- Static file serving through `/public`
- hot reloading on file update
