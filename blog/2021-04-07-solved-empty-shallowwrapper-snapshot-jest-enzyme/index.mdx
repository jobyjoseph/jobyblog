# SOLVED: Empty ShallowWrapper Snapshot Object in Jest and Enzyme

When working with Jest v24 and above, developers are facing an issue with snapshot testing.

## The Issue

In my code, I am working with Jest v26 and Enzyme v3. In unit testing, I am doing **snapshot testing** with code like below.

```javascript
import { shallow } from "enzyme";
import App from "./App";

const app = shallow(<App />);

it("renders correctly", () => {
  expect(app).toMatchSnapshot(); // check if a component renders correctly
});
```

When the tests are running, it creates a `__snapshots__` folder. But the snapshot is storing an empty object like below.

```javascript
exports[`renders correctly 1`] = `ShallowWrapper {}`;
```

However we update our `App` component, the snapshot is not going to change. This results in always passing snapshot tests, since there is no change when the generated snapshots are compared.

## Solution

The key issue is, for some reasons the module which converts a component to json string is not working. How to fix it?

### Downgrade Jest

Developers are saying this issue started from Jest v24. So most of them are downgrading Jest to v23. If that is ok in your project, you can try that.

### Enzyme to JSON

In this solution, we are installing an extra package to do enzyme to json conversion.

First of all, install `enzyme-to-json` as a dev dependancy in your project.

```
yarn add --dev enzyme-to-json
```

Now tell Jest to use `snapshotSerializers` from `enzyme-to-json`. To do that, add a new key called `"jest"` in `package.json` and mention the new serializer.

```javascript
// package.json
// { ...
  "jest": {
    "snapshotSerializers": [
      "enzyme-to-json/serializer"
    ]
  }
// }
```

Now when we run the test, correct JSON is written to snapshot file. Now the snapshot written will look like this:

```javascript
exports[`renders correctly 1`] = `
<div>
  Hello World
</div>
`;
```

### React Test Renderer

React Test Renderer can be used to create snapshots. It is not a helper for Enzyme. Instead it is a replacement for Enzyme. First install it using:

```
yarn add --dev react-test-renderer
```

Now the `App.test.js` file should contain below code.

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { create } from "react-test-renderer";
import App from "./App";

const app = create(<App />);

it("renders correctly", () => {
  expect(app.toJSON()).toMatchSnapshot(); // check if a component renders correctly
});
```

`create()` method is similar to `shallow()` in Enzyme. `.toJSON()` method generates the json to be written to snapshot file.
