**Question:**

When should we use React Context instead of prop-drilling?

> _prop-drilling_ refers to the technique where we pass a value from one component to nested components through props.

**Answer:**

If we have a value that could be accessed anywhere from the application, we can consider **Context**. Few examples that fit to this condition is:

- Dark or light theme for a site
- Global site level theme settings
- User authentication status like is guest or is registered.

If the value shared by a component is specific to that component and its children, it is good to use prop-drilling. That improves code readability and the developer can easily identify from where this value is coming.

**Question:**

Here we have a set of 5 React components that is nested one inside other. Component `A` is passing a value to component `E` through prop-drilling.

```javascript
const E = (props) => <h1>{props.fruit}</h1>;
const D = (props) => <E fruit={props.fruit} />;
const C = (props) => <D fruit={props.fruit} />;
const B = (props) => <C fruit={props.fruit} />;
const A = (props) => <B fruit={props.fruit} />;

<A fruit="Apple" />;
```

How can we rewrite the same code using `useContext()`?

**Answer:**

```javascript
import React, { useContext } from "react";

const FruitContext = React.createContext();

const E = (props) => {
  const fruit = useContext(FruitContext);
  return <h1>{fruit}</h1>;
};

const D = (props) => <E />;
const C = (props) => <D />;
const B = (props) => <C />;

const A = (props) => (
  <FruitContext.Provider value="Apple">
    <B />
  </FruitContext.Provider>
);

export default A;
```
