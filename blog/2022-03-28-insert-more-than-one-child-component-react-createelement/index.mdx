As React developers, we mainly work with JSX. But, after transpiling the code, JSX is entirely converted to pure JavaScript. Each component is created using `React.createElement()`.

Consider the following code in JSX. It has a parent tag with 3 children.

```html
<Student>
  <Name>John Doe</Name>
  <Age>36</Age>
  <Gender>Male</Gender>
</Student>
```

We can see the output of JSX to JavaScript [here](https://babeljs.io/repl). Here is the output:

```javascript
"use strict";

/*#__PURE__*/
React.createElement(
  Student,
  null,
  /*#__PURE__*/ React.createElement(Name, null, "John Doe"),
  /*#__PURE__*/ React.createElement(Age, null, "36"),
  /*#__PURE__*/ React.createElement(Gender, null, "Male"),
);
```

As we can see, each child is passed to the parent `React.createElement()` method as an argument. So, in this case we had to pass total 5 arguments to the parent `createElement()` invocation.

We can also pass the three children as an **array**. That means, we are passing only 3 arguments in total and the third argument is an array.

```javascript
"use strict";

/*#__PURE__*/
React.createElement(Student, null, [
  /*#__PURE__*/ React.createElement(Name, null, "John Doe"),
  /*#__PURE__*/ React.createElement(Age, null, "36"),
  /*#__PURE__*/ React.createElement(Gender, null, "Male"),
]);
```

This is how we can use `React.createElement()` to pass multiple child components.
