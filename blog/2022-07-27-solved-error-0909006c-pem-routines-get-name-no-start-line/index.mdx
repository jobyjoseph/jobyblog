description: "When making a request to a HTTPS end point, we might need to pass the certificate also. This error usually comes if the certificate file is invalid."

I was working on a code deployed in AWS Lambda. The code is written in Node.js. Using `axios` package, we are making a request to a new HTTPS API endpoint. We already had a mail containing different formats of SSL certificates used by the API server.

We took the first certificate format and attached it to our `axios` request as an _http agent_ object. The request failed and the error we saw is this:

```
error:0909006C:PEM routines:get_name:no start line
```

The issue was that, we took the **incorrect PEM** file from the mail. It did not contain proper header and footer.

In ideal case, the certificate when opened should contain the proper header and footer. If we open the certificate file using a text editor, we should see a proper header and footer like below:

```
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIG9jCCBd6gAwIBAgIQEQOjsh7xKPOteKIB7X4PNTANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQsFADCB

bcb4pyNYC84jspwdaiL62PNAAQPhIZnQytxgJMzd7gD3OpFYapbTVCHqV9/fdGsZ
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

In my case, the proper header(`-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----`) and footer(`-----END CERTIFICATE-----`) were missing. When I used the file with correct header and footer, the axios request worked.
