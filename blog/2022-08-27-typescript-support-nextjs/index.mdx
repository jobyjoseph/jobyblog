A Next.js project can be easily setup using `create-next-app` command.

```
npx create-next-app@latest
```

But the project created using above command does not support TypeScript. If we want to add TypeScript support, we need to manually add TypeScript related configuration to the project.

There is an easier technique. The `create-next-app` command accepts flags. Passing a `--typescript` flag setup a Next.js project with TypeScript support.

```
npx create-next-app@latest --typescript
```

After setting up, if we open the project, we can see TypeScript specific changes.

As we can see, there is a `tsconfig.json` file in the project root folder. All the page files are in `.tsx` extension. We can also see the type information inside the page file.
