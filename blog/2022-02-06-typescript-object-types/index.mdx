Objects in JavaScript consist of key value pairs. An object consist of different properties. Each property can contain a data value of certain type. **Setting types of an object properties and recursively applying this process to nested objects defines the type of an object**.

Here is a simple JavaScript object.

```javascript
{
    name: "Joby",
    age: 35
}
```

As we can see, `name` property contains string value and `age` contains a number. Therefore, we can define the type of above object as:

```typescript
{
    name: string,
    age: number
}
```

We saw the object and associated type. In actual code, this is how we can declare a variable and attach an object type.

```typescript
let student: {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

student = {
  name: "Joby",
  age: 35,
};
```

The object value we passed to `student` matches the defined type. What if we assign a different object to `student` as shown below?

```typescript
student = {
  name: "Joby",
  age: 35,
  year: 2022,
};
```

TypeScript in this case clearly points out the extra `year` property. See how detail TypeScript is in the error message.

```
error TS2322: Type '{ name: string; age: number; year: number; }' is not assignable to type '{ name: string; age: number; }'.
  Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'year' does not exist in type '{ name: string; age: number; }'.
```

## Object as Function Argument

When a function accepts an object as argument, we can again define the type of object accepted by the function. If there is a function `foo()` that accepts above `student` object, this is how the function declaration looks like.

```typescript
function foo(student: { name: string; age: number }) {
  return;
}
```

We can then call the function `foo()` by passing an object with only `name` and `age` property.

```typescript
foo({
  name: "Joby",
  age: 35,
});
```

Adding an extra parameter to the argument object throws an error. Let us pass an object to `foo()` that contains 3 properties.

```typescript
foo({
  name: "Joby",
  age: 35,
  year: 2022,
});
```

TypeScript clearly points out the error. Let me paste the exact error message below. See for yourself how descriptive it is.

`error TS2345: Argument of type '{ name: string; age: number; year: number; }' is not assignable to parameter of type '{ name: string; age: number; }'. Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'year' does not exist in type '{ name: string; age: number; }'.`

## Optional Properties in Objects

In an object, few properties can be **optional**. Consider the following object:

```javascript
{
  name: "Joby",
  status: "married",
  spouse: "Ninu"
}
```

In the above object, `spouse` key is not required if `status` is `single`. While defining type for such fields, we can mark a property as optional by `?` operator. Here is the type definition for our object.

```typescript
{
  name: string
  status: string
  spouse?: string
}
```
