While watching different tutorial videos, one thing which I always noticed is the cool icons in the instructor's IDE. I am using Visual Studio Code IDE. In VS code, we can bring cool icons with the help of an extension called **vscode-icons**.

## Installation

First open VS code.

Then click on _Extensions_ tab.

Then search for _vscode-icons_ by VSCode Icons Team.

![VS Code Icons](./images/vscode-icons-extension.png)

Install the extension.

After installation, the icons appear next to each files and folders. The extension itself has more than 11 million downloads so far at the time of writing. Enjoy!.
