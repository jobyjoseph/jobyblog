While working with Next.js you might face this unhandled runtime error:

```
ChunkLoadError: Loading chunk node_modules_next_dist_client_dev_noop_js failed.
```

<!-- truncate -->

This is a bug from Next.js side. You can try few things if you face this issue.

**Solution:**

Next.js creates a `.next` folder while building. It stores all the required bundle files to run Next.js. **Delete** this folder from the root of your project. Rebuild your project. Clear browser cache and try again.
