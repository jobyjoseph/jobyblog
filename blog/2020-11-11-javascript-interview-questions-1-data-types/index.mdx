# JavaScript Interview Questions 1 - Data Types

**Question 1:**

What are the data types we have in latest JavaScript?

**Answer:**

We have 8 data types. They are:

1. Boolean
2. null
3. undefined
4. Number
5. BigInt
6. String
7. Symbol
8. Object

**Question 2:**

What are falsy values in JavaScript? List the values that are falsy in JavaScript.

**Answer:**

Those values when converted to a Boolean type results in `false` are called falsy values. Here are the list of falsy values in JavaScript.

- `0`
- `-0`
- `null`
- `false` Obviously
- `NaN`
- `undefined`
- `""` Empty string

**Question 3:**

What is the output of following code? Please explain your answer.

```javascript
if ({}) {
  console.log("I am true");
} else {
  console.log("I am false");
}
```

**Answer:**

It prints `"I am true"` in the console. Any object, even empty object is a truthy value in JavaScript.

**Question 4:**

In JavaScript, how can we convert a value to boolean type?

**Answer:**

One way is to use `Boolean()` function.

```javascript
console.log(Boolean("A string")); // true
console.log(Boolean("")); // false
console.log(Boolean(0)); // false
console.log(Boolean({})); // true
```

Another way is to use double negation operator `!!`.

```javascript
console.log(!!"hello"); // true
```

**Question 5:**

What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?

**Answer:**

Both `null` and `undefined` behaves almost the same way when used in code. But as part of best practice, difference between those two lies in their usage.

`null` represents intentional absence of an object. That means, if there is a place where the code expects an object, but we are unable to provide one, then we give back `null`. Example: `match()` is a string method that returns an array of all matches of a supplied pattern.

```javascript
const str = "Orange is orange";
const result = str.match(/orange/gi);
console.log(result); // ["Orange", "orange"]
```

Here the `match()` method returned an array. After all, array is a type of object. So, we can say that, `result` is always expecting an object. If there was no match found, then there is no object to return to `result`. In order to state an intentional absence of an object, `match()` method returns `null` if no match is found.

```javascript
const str = "Orange is orange";
const result = str.match(/Apple/gi);
console.log(result); // null
```

On the other hand, `undefined` is the value of a variable that is declared, but not initialized. Also, a function in JavaScript by default returns `undefined`. So in those context, we can use `undefined`.

**Question 6:**

I need to check if the value of variable `a` is `undefined`. For that, I wrote the following code:

```javascript
if (a === undefined) {
  console.log("a is declared");
} else {
  console.log("a is declared and initialized");
}
```

What happened is, if `a` is not declared, above code throws `ReferenceError` in the first line. How can we resolve this issue?

**Answer:**

We can use `typeof` operator.

```javascript
if (typeof a === "undefined") {
  // ...
}
```

`typeof` does not throw error for undeclared variables.
