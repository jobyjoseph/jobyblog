Webpack creates bundle file and store it in a distribution folder. The default distribution folder is `/dist` folder. If each bundle is created with different file names, the distribution folder will be crowded with previous version of bundle files.

Here is a webpack configuration that creates output file with the hash value.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  output: {
    filename: "[contenthash].js",
  },
};
```

Above configuration, first generates a hash value of the source content. Then the hash value is given as the output bundle file name. This technique is helpful with respect to **caching** because the output filename changes only when source changes.

But, the problem is that, for each content change, the output `/dist` folder is filling up.

![Ouput dist folder](./images/dist-folder.png)

We can avoid this crowding by adding `clean` attribute to `output` configuration.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  output: {
    filename: "[contenthash].js",
    clean: true, // highlight-line
  },
};
```

Now, after each build, only the generated bundle files will be there in the `dist` folder.
