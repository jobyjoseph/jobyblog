# TypeScript Interview Questions Part 4 - Interfaces, Type Aliases

**Question:**

What are Type Aliases?

**Answer:**

Type Aliases allow us to give a type a name. Here is an example of how a type alias is created.

```typescript
type stringOrNumber = string | number;

let pincode: stringOrNumber;
```

`stringOrNumber` is a type alias. It can be used with any variables that can contain either a string value or number value.

**Question:**

Here we have an interface `Person`.

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}
```

We need to create a new interface `Teacher` that has 3 properties, `name`, `age` and `subject`. How to approach this issue?

**Answer:**

`Teacher` is a more specific version of `Person`. So, we can do this by extending `Person` interface.

```typescript
interface Teacher extends Person {
  subject: string;
}
```

And later, we can use `Teacher` type while creating an object.

```typescript
const obj: Teacher = {
  name: "John",
  age: 23,
  subject: "Science",
};
```

**Question:**

Here is a TypeScript code that creates a custom type.

```typescript
type stringOrNumber = string | number;
```

Can we rewrite above line using `interface`?

**Answer:**

Interfaces can deal with JavaScript objects and its sub types. They cannot work with primitive data types. Therefore, we cannot convert this code using `interface`.

**Question:**

Here is a function written in TypeScript.

```typescript
function sum(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
```

Please write down the interface for the above function.

**Answer:**

Here is the interface for the `sum()` function:

```typescript
interface sum {
  (a: number, b: number): number;
}
```

---

**Question:**

We have a TypeScript file with only type definitions like below.

```typescript
interface sum {
  (a: number, b: number): number;
}

interface show {
  (message: string): void;
}
```

Please write down the JavaScript code that is produced after TypeScript compilation.

**Answer:**

TypeScript performs static type checking. The interfaces and types in the TypeScript code is used by `tsc` compiler for static type checking. The output JavaScript file does not contain any type information. Therefore, in this case, the output JavaScript file will not contain any code.

**Question:**

We have a function type definition here created using `interface`.

```typescript
interface show {
  (message: string): void;
}
```

Write the same definition using `type` keyword.

**Answer:**

Here is the type definition created using `type` keyword.

```typescript
type show = (message: string) => void;
```
