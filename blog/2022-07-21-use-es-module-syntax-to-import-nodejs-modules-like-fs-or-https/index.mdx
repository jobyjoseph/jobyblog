In Node.js each `.js` file is considered as a separate CommonJS module. That means if we declare a variable or function inside a file, we cannot access it from another file. We need to explicitly mention, what all variables and functions can be accessed by other files.

## Import Core Node Modules in CommonJS Way

We know that Node.js comes with multiple modules like `fs` or `https` out of the box. If we need to use say, `fs` in our code, here is the syntax.

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

// Then use it like..
fs.readFileSync();
```

## Import Core Node Modules in ES Module Way

If we are rewriting above code in ES Module way, it looks like this:

```javascript
import * as fs from "fs";

fs.readFileSync();
```

Above syntax is one of the way in which we use `import` keyword. It takes all exported variables or functions from `fs` package and make it available for use.

Here are other ways we use `import` keyword.

```javascript
import defaultExport from "module-name";
import * as name from "module-name";
import { export1 } from "module-name";
import { export1 as alias1 } from "module-name";
import { default as alias } from "module-name";
import { export1 , export2 } from "module-name";
import { export1 , export2 as alias2 , [...] } from "module-name";
import { "string name" as alias } from "module-name";
import defaultExport, { export1 [ , [...] ] } from "module-name";
import defaultExport, * as name from "module-name";
import "module-name";
```
