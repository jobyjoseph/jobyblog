TypeScript is a **syntactic superset** of JavaScript. It means, it starts with basic JavaScript syntax, and then start building more type specific syntax on top of it. TypeScript is an **open-source** project maintained by Microsoft. The main goal is to add **types** to JavaScript.

Here is an example TypeScript code to declare a string type variable.

```typescript
let name: string;
```

A TypeScript code is compiled by a TypeScript compiler and outputs JavaScript code.

## Why Choose TypeScript?

One reason is developers can be bring their **intent to the code**. For example, below function is to add 2 numbers, NOT to concatenate 2 strings.

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

But how to express our intent? We can do using TypeScript.

```typescript
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
```

Now if somebody use the function like `add("b", 3)`, TypeScript compiler will throw an error.

Second reason is TypeScript can **detect some errors at compile time** rather than at run time. Examples are:

- Errors occuring due to `null` or `undefined` values in variables
- Bad reference variables. You changed the name of a function, but forgot to replace the new name in all occurences.
- Breakage around internal code contract. ie, earlier an argument was optional, but now it is mandatory.

Third reason is the **code development experience** with TypeScript. TypeScript gels well with Visual Studio Code. Both are from Microsoft. When working with TypeScript, the intellisense support and documentation support is great.

## TypeScript Online Editor

If you want to try TypeScript syntax quickly, TypeScript language provides an online editor at https://www.typescriptlang.org/play. Also https://www.typescriptlang.org/ is the official website of TypeScript.

## Typed Future JavaScript

Another question that comes to developers is about future JavaScript. Will JavaScript in near future bring type support? I don't think so.

Assume, JavaScript bring following syntax tomorrow:

```javascript
string name = "Jack";
```

It is going to break a lot of JavaScript code floating on web starting from 90s. So it is good and advisable to learn TypeScript.
