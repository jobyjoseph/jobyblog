Class Field Declarations feature is in **Stage 4** of TC39 process. It is expected to be launched in the year 2022. This proposal was authored by [Daniel Ehrenberg](https://github.com/littledan). [Kevin Gibbons](https://github.com/bakkot) is the champion for this proposal.

## Field Declarations

In ES2015 we can declare classes using `class` keyword. Here is a simple class for counter.

```javascript
class Counter {
  constructor() {
    this.count = 0;
  }

  incrementCount() {
    this.count++;
    console.log(this.count);
  }
}
```

`count` is used to keep track of the count. Each time, `incrementCount()` is called, the value of `count` is incremented by 1.

```javascript
const counter1 = new Counter();
counter1.incrementCount();
counter1.incrementCount();
```

Above code prints `1` and `2` in the console.

```
1
2
```

**Field Declarations** helps to declare the fields(`count`) immediately under `Counter` and improve code readability. Above class can be modified using field declarations as shown below.

```javascript
class Counter {
  count = 0; // highlight-line

  incrementCount() {
    this.count++;
    console.log(this.count);
  }
}
```

The output will be same, but the code is now **more readable**. In the above example, we have initialized the value of `count`. We can also just declare a variable without initialization.

```javascript
class Counter {
  count; // highlight-line

  print() {
    console.log(this.count);
  }
}

const counter = new Counter();
counter.print(); // undefined
```

## Private Fields

By default, any fields in a class are **public**. For example, consider below code.

```javascript
class Counter {
  count = 0;

  increment() {
    this.count++;
    console.log(this.count);
  }
}
```

Here `count` is a field declared to keep track of the count. Each invocation of `increment()` updates the count value and prints it. What if someone updates the `count` value outside of `increment()` method?

```javascript
const counter = new Counter();
counter.increment(); // 1
counter.count = 5;
counter.increment(); // 6
counter.increment(); // 7
```

Since the `count` field is updated to 5, last 2 `increment()` methods print 6 and 7. How can we keep the `count` field **private**?. Only `increment()` method should update the value of `count`. We can set `count` as private by adding `#` before the field.

```javascript
class Counter {
  #count = 0;

  increment() {
    this.#count++;
    console.log(this.#count);
  }
}
```

Now let us see how previous invocation works. The output of each line is shown as comment.

```javascript
const counter = new Counter();
counter.increment(); // 1
counter.count = 5;
counter.increment(); // 2
counter.increment(); // 3
```

We can see that `counter.count = 5` does not throw any error. But there is **no effect**. The `count` field is udpated only through `increment()` method.

By making private fields, ECMAScript classes provides better **encapsulation**. There is no chance of accidental updation of internal fields.

### Dynamic Private Fields

Dynamic creation of private fields are not allowed. If we want to use any private fields, we need to declare it first on top of the class.

Here is a class that has one field(`count1`) declared on top. If we call `setCount()` method, two more fields, `count2` and `count3` are added to the instance object.

```javascript
class Counter {
  count1 = 0;

  setCount() {
    this.count2 = 0;
    this.count3 = 0;
  }
}

const counter = new Counter();
console.log(Object.keys(counter).length); // 1
counter.setCount();
console.log(Object.keys(counter).length); // 3
```

As we can see, before `setCount()` invocation, there was only one field. After the invocation, the field count is 3.

Now, let us convert all the fields as **private**.

```javascript
class Counter {
  #count1 = 0;

  setCount() {
    this.#count2 = 0;
    this.#count3 = 0;
  }
}
```

When `setCount()` is invoked, `this.#count2` throws following error.

```
Uncaught SyntaxError: Private field '#count2' must be declared in an enclosing class
```

This says that, we can create public fields dynamically, but not private fields.
