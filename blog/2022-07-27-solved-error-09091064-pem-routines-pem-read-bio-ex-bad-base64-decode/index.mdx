In my project, I am using `axios` to make request to a HTTPS API endpoint. I had to pass the PEM certificate also to make the request work. When making the request, I was thrown with below error:

```
error:09091064:PEM routines:PEM_read_bio_ex:bad base64 decode
```

The reason for this error message is that, **the certificate file got corrupted for some reason**.

In my case, I was trying to create the PEM file by copying the content from `crt` file. During this process, I accidently deleted one line. When pasted with the correct content, issue got resolved.
