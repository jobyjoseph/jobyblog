I have two accounts in Bitbucket. One is my personal account which I registered using my personal email account. Other one is my official account registered using my office email. When I moved from HTTP to SSH in Bitbucket, I had to generate two separate SSH keys for both accounts.

So now I have two SSH keys in my laptop. When trying to push code to my personal account, how can Bitbucket know which SSH key to use? I faced this issue. My already working repo start yelling that I do not have access to the repo.

To teach Bitbucket which SSH key to use with which account, we need to do following steps.

First, create a file in `~/.ssh` folder with name `config`. No extensions!. My SSH keys are stored in `~/.ssh` folder.

Open `config` file in some editor and paste following content:

```
 #Personal account
 Host bitbucket.org-jobyjoseph
     HostName bitbucket.org
     User git
     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
     IdentitiesOnly yes

 #Official account
 Host bitbucket.org-jobylitmus7
     HostName bitbucket.org
     User git
     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/ed25519_bitbucket_litmus7
     IdentitiesOnly yes
```

Replace `jobyjoseph` and `jobylitmus7` with your Bitbucket user names. Then replace `id_ed25519` and `ed25519_bitbucket_litmus7` with the file names of your SSH files.
